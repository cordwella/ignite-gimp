# GIMP Batch templating for IGNITE codes.

This is a gimp plugin (python) for use with [IGNITE](http://www.github.com/cordwella/ignite) QR codes.

It takes a folder filled with QR codes generated from the IGNITE admin site, as well
as a folder with house logos in them, and generates nice sheets of 4 codes with
the name, code and house logo on them.

The output images are A4 side, however we found during our original run of the
game that we tended to print two of these pages on a single A4 sheet if we were
just putting the codes around the school.
